      <h2>Global Conflict Visualization</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        This section focuses on geographic perspectives of war: where wars occur, how long they
        tend to last in different locations, and how intense conflict has been across broad
        world regions. We combine a choropleth map, a bubble map, a regional dumbbell chart and the bivariate choropleth to summarize 
        war frequency and duration in a spatially-aware way.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CHOROPLETH -->
    <section id="section-4" class="section card" aria-label="Choropleth of wars">
      <h3>Choropleth Map — Number of Wars per Country</h3>
      <div class="chart-placeholder2" data-chart="s4-choropleth">
        Choropleth placeholder
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        Countries are shaded according to how many wars in the dataset are associated with
        their territory. Darker shades indicate locations with a higher frequency of recorded
        wars over the 1816–2001 period.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- BUBBLE MAP -->
    <section class="section card" aria-label="Bubble map of durations">
      <h3>Bubble Map — Average War Duration per Country</h3>
      <div class="chart-placeholder2" data-chart="s4-bubble">
        Bubble map placeholder
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        On top of a neutral world map, each country that appears in the dataset is marked with
        a circle whose size reflects the average duration of wars fought there. This highlights
        countries where conflicts tend to be unusually short or long, in a geographically
        intuitive way.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- REGIONAL DUMBBELL -->
    <section class="section card" aria-label="Regional dumbbell chart">
      <h3>Regional Dumbbell Chart — War Frequency vs Average Duration</h3>
      <div class="chart-placeholder2" data-chart="s4-dumbbell">
        Dumbbell chart placeholder
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        For the regions with the most recorded wars, this dumbbell chart compares two
        normalized metrics side by side: how frequently wars occur and how long they last
        on average. Each horizontal line represents a geographic region, with endpoints
        showing its relative war frequency and relative average duration on a common scale.
      </p>
    </section>
        <!-- BIVARIATE CHOROPLETH -->
        <section class="section card" aria-label="Bivariate choropleth">
            <h3>Bivariate Choropleth Map — War Frequency × Average Duration</h3>
            <div class="chart-placeholder2" data-chart="s4-bivariate">
              Bivariate choropleth placeholder
            </div>
            <p class="muted">
              This map encodes two dimensions of conflict intensity at the same time:
              how frequently wars occur in each country (war count) and how long they last
              on average (duration). Countries are grouped into categories such as
              “High frequency / High duration” or “Low frequency / Low duration”, allowing us
              to quickly spot places where conflict is both frequent and protracted.
