    <h2>About This Section</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      This section explores how long wars typically last. We start with an overall histogram,
      then compare distributions by war purpose, and finally summarize spread and central tendency with boxplots.
      Most wars in the dataset are short and end within a few years, regardless of their purpose.
Only a small number of wars—especially ethnic and secessionist ones—last much longer, creating a long-tailed distribution of conflict duration.

  <!-- Histogram -->
  <section id="charts" class="section card">
    <h3>Histogram — War Durations (Years)</h3>
    <div class="chart-placeholder2" data-chart="s2-hist">Histogram placeholder</div>
    <p class="muted">A binned distribution showing how many wars fall into each duration range.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Violin -->
  <section class="section card">
    <h3>Violin Plot — Duration by Purpose: Distribution shape of war durations across the top eight purposes.</h3>
    <div class="chart-placeholder2" data-chart="s2-violin">Violin placeholder</div>
    <p class="muted">Most wars, regardless of their purpose, are short-lived — usually lasting less than five years.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Boxplot -->
  <section class="section card">
    <h3>Boxplot — Duration by Purpose: Median, quartiles, and outliers of war durations grouped by purpose.</h3>
    <div class="chart-placeholder2" data-chart="s2-box">Boxplot placeholder</div>
    <p class="muted">Most wars — regardless of their purpose — are short-term, but in certain categories, such as ethnic civil wars, there’s a much higher chance of very long, drawn-out conflicts.
